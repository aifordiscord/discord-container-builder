# Discord Container Builder

## Overview

Discord Container Builder is a TypeScript library that provides a simplified, developer-friendly API wrapper around Discord.js v2 Components. The library aims to reduce boilerplate code and improve readability when creating Discord bot UI components like buttons, select menus, text displays, and separators.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The project follows a modular builder pattern architecture, wrapping Discord.js v2 Components with cleaner, more intuitive APIs. The library is designed as a TypeScript NPM package that acts as a wrapper layer over Discord.js, providing simplified methods and chainable interfaces for component creation.

### Key Architectural Decisions:
- **Builder Pattern**: Each component type has its own builder class that wraps the corresponding Discord.js builder
- **Method Chaining**: All builder methods return `this` to enable fluent interface patterns
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety with comprehensive type definitions
- **Wrapper Architecture**: Maintains compatibility with Discord.js while providing simplified APIs

## Key Components

### Core Builders
1. **ContainerBuilder** - Main wrapper for Discord.js ContainerBuilder, orchestrates all component types
2. **TextDisplayBuilder** - Simplified text display component creation with formatting helpers
3. **SeparatorBuilder** - Easy separator creation with spacing and divider options
4. **ActionRowBuilder** - Streamlined action row management with callback-based component addition
5. **ButtonBuilder** - Enhanced button creation with style shortcuts and emoji support
6. **StringSelectMenuBuilder** - Simplified select menu creation with option management

### Utility Components
- **Constants** - Common emojis, button styles, and spacing sizes
- **Types** - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- **Examples** - Comprehensive usage examples and patterns

## Data Flow

1. **Component Creation**: Developers use simplified builder classes instead of raw Discord.js builders
2. **Method Chaining**: Builders support fluent interfaces for readable component construction
3. **Internal Wrapping**: Each simplified builder wraps a corresponding Discord.js builder internally
4. **Build Process**: Components are converted to Discord.js format via `.build()` or automatically during container assembly
5. **Discord Integration**: Final components are fully compatible with Discord.js v2 message sending

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **discord.js**: Version ^14.0.0 (peer dependency) - The underlying Discord API library
- **TypeScript**: Version ^5.8.3 - Primary development language

### Development Dependencies
- **Jest**: Testing framework with TypeScript support
- **ESLint**: Code linting with TypeScript rules
- **Rollup**: Module bundling for distribution
- **Prettier**: Code formatting

### Build Tools
- **ts-jest**: TypeScript integration for Jest
- **rollup-plugin-dts**: TypeScript declaration bundling
- **@rollup/plugin-typescript**: TypeScript compilation for Rollup

## Deployment Strategy

The project is configured as an NPM package with the following distribution strategy:

### Build Process
1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Source files compiled to JavaScript
2. **Module Formats**: Both CommonJS (`dist/index.js`) and ES Modules (`dist/index.esm.js`) supported
3. **Type Definitions**: Bundled TypeScript definitions (`dist/index.d.ts`)
4. **Source Maps**: Generated for debugging support

### Publishing Configuration
- **Package Name**: `discord-container-builder`
- **Registry**: NPM public registry
- **Entry Points**: Multiple format support (CJS, ESM, TypeScript)
- **Files Included**: `dist/`, `src/`, `examples/`, `README.md`

### Quality Assurance
- **Pre-publish Hooks**: Automated build and test execution
- **Linting**: TypeScript ESLint rules enforcement
- **Testing**: Jest-based unit test suite
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript compilation

The library is designed to be imported and used alongside Discord.js in Discord bot projects, providing a more ergonomic developer experience while maintaining full compatibility with the underlying Discord.js v2 Components system.
